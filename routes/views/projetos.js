These projects, including the Flagship Project, are decided and implemented by the association as a whole and can call on the resources of AEGEE-Europe for support. They deal with topics of interest for the European youth in general. These European projects are coordinated by international teams and consist of actions taken in several countries. These actions are usually varied, and creativity is crucial for developing a successful project: conferences, seminars, action days, contests, and any other way of involving young people in the topic can contribute to a project.",
