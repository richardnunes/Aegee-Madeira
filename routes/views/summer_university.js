        text: "The Summer University Project was born in 1988, with the intention to promote European integration. <strong>Every summer, it mobilises over 2000 young Europeans.</strong> The events of the projects are based on a cultural exchange, where understanding and exploring the multicultural dimension of the European continent, fighting for tolerance and becoming open-minded citizens are common themes. The activities carried out during a Summer University range from academic, such as classes to learn a foreign language, different courses on technical themes to multicultural activities: get familiar with Finnish culture, Spanish history, Greek mythology; learn how to sail, attend a photography course in Turkey or do hike in Polish woods, etc. Moreover, each Summer University follows a concrete theme throughout its duration that can be related to European Integration, International Politics, Active Citizenship, Education, Culture, Peace, Personal Development and many more.",
