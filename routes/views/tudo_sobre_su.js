                a: "The Summer University is an event that takes place during summer between one and four weeks in most of the cities that AEGEE is present. Understanding and exploring the multicultural dimension of the European continent, removing national borders, fighting for tolerance and creating open-minded citizens are some of the reasons why 20 to 50 young Europeans from all over Europe come together in each Summer University to taste the diversity of multiculturalism." +
                    "<p>The Summer University Project was born in 1988 with the intention to promote the European Integration. This project is the main tool of AEGEE to attain this difficult but fascinating target. Since that time, it has been continuing every year with the participation of more than 120 antennae.</p>" +
                    "<p>The activities carried out during a Summer University range from academic, such as classes to learn a foreign language, different courses on technical themes to multicultural activities: get familiar with Finnish culture, Spanish history, Greek mythology; learn how to sail, attend a photography course in Turkey or do hike in Polish woods, etc. Moreover, each Summer University follows a concrete theme throughout its duration that can be related to European Integration, International Politics, Active Citizenship, Education, Culture, Peace, Personal Development and many more.</p>" +
                    "<p>In a Summer University you will be given the chance to taste different food, to listen to different music, to dance with that music and at the end love it, to be good friends with people from different countries and then arranging trips together, you will learn to say &quot;hi&quot; in another 20 languages, you will feel free, you will love, you will experience, you will learn new things, you will do things you hadn't imagined… You will feel the AEGEE spirit, you will feel what is a SU!</p>"

It has a duration of two to four weeks. Participants receive at least 14 hours of tuition per week. The fee of 11 Euros/night includes tuition, lodging, two meals per day (of which one is warm) and a social program.</p>" +

The fee of 14 Euros/night includes tuition, lodging, two meals per day (of which one is warm) and a social programme.</p>" +

During the 2-4 weeks of cultural trip through a part of Europe, the group stays in at least 4 different places. The aim of this event is to combine the different lifestyles and cultures of the places visited with acourse provided like in Summer Course. Since there is a lot of time spent in travelling, the tuition hours are less than Summer Course, but at least 10 hours per week. The fee of 14 Euros/night includes lodging, two meals per day (of which one is warm), travel costs from the first to the last place mentioned in the programme, and a social programme.</p>"

So, just write a letter of at least 500 characters to show that you are the ideal participant!</p>" +
